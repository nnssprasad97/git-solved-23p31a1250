## Most Challenging Parts

1. Understanding conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. Choosing which code to keep
3. Resolving complex scripts
4. Testing after resolution

---

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills

- Conflict resolution process
- Merge conflict markers
- git diff, rebase, cherry-pick, reset, reflog

### Best Practices

- Read both sides carefully
- Test before committing
- Write clear commit messages
- Use git status frequently

### Git Workflow Insights

- Conflicts are normal
- Understand both changes before merging
- Document your resolutions

---

## Reflection

Merge conflicts aren’t scary—they’re Git asking for a decision. This challenge taught me that understanding both sides of a conflict is more important than rushing to resolve it. By carefully reviewing each change, testing after resolution, and documenting my steps, I gained confidence in handling even complex conflicts safely.

Practicing advanced Git commands like **rebase**, **cherry-pick**, **reset**, and **reflog** helped me understand different workflows and how to recover lost commits or integrate changes without errors. I now know the difference between merge and rebase, when to use each, and how to maintain a clean project history.

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of patience, clarity, and testing when working with Git. I feel well-prepared to manage version control in real-world projects, collaborate effectively with teams, and confidently resolve conflicts when they arise.
